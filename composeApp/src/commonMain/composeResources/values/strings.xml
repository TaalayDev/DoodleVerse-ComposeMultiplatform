    <string name="chibi_dog_lesson_1_description">Start by drawing a large circle to form the base shape of the chibi dog's head. This circle will serve as the foundation for the character's face.</string>
    <string name="chibi_dog_lesson_2_description">Add curved lines to outline the sides of the face, creating chubby cheeks and a slight point for the chin.</string>
    <string name="chibi_dog_lesson_3_description">Add two large triangular shapes on top of the head for the ears. Position them symmetrically and add smaller inner triangles to create the inner ear details.</string>
    <string name="chibi_dog_lesson_4_description">Draw two large oval shapes for the eyes, positioning them near the center of the head. Add small circles inside the eyes to represent the pupils.</string>
    <string name="chibi_dog_lesson_5_description">Add a small, curved line below the eyes to form the nose. Draw a small, curved line below the nose to create the mouth.</string>
    <string name="chibi_dog_lesson_6_description">Enhance the dog's expression by adding additional details to the face as in the guidelines.</string>
    <string name="chibi_dog_lesson_7_description">Erase the unnecessary guideline elements while retaining the essential parts like the curved outlines of the face and ears. This step refines the drawing and prepares it for further details.</string>
    <string name="chibi_dog_lesson_8_description">Sketch the chibi dog's body with rounded, soft edges. Add the front legs, keeping them symmetrical, and shape the paws with simple curves.</string>
    <string name="chibi_dog_lesson_9_description">Draw the chibi dog's tail with a curved, fluffy shape. Add a zigzag pattern along the edge to emphasize the fluffiness and make it look lively.</string>
    <string name="chibi_dog_lesson_10_description">To enhance the dog's appearance, add some fluffy fur details to its chest and legs. Draw curved, jagged lines to indicate soft fur.</string>
    <string name="chibi_dog_lesson_11_description">Review your drawing and make any necessary adjustments to refine the lines and details. Erase any remaining guidelines and ensure the drawing is clean and polished.</string>

    <string name="dimple_cat_lesson_2_description">Draw the outline of the cat's cheeks and jawline by creating two curved lines that extend outward from the bottom sides of the circle.</string>
